# 👋 Hey there, I'm Akan!

🚀 **Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Problem-Solver**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This is where my software engineering journey took off, and I'm just getting warmed up. I love crafting solutions that make a real impact—whether it's building cool apps, optimizing performance, or solving complex problems. Every line of code I write is a step toward something bigger (and fewer late-night debugging sessions, hopefully). Grab a cup of coffee ☕ and explore my projects!
